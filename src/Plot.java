/*
* Class: CMSC 203 CRN 22608
* Instructor: Ahmed Tarek
* Description: A property management company manages individual properties they will build to rent, and charges
them a management fee as the percentages of the monthly rental amount. The properties cannot overlap
each other, and each property must be within the limits of the management companyâ€™s plot. Write an
application that lets the user create a management company and add the properties managed by the
company to its list.
* Due: 10/28/2025
* Platform/compiler: Eclipse IDE
* I pledge that I have completed the programming
* assignment independently. I have not copied the code
* from a student or any source. I have not given my code
* to any student.
